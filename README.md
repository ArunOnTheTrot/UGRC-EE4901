This is my Undergraduate Research Mini Project, which is based on Optimization of Placements in Mixed Size Circuits. 
Placement is one of the most critical steps in a physical design flow.
Hence, the current methods focus on building up a pseudo energy/potential between the components to be placed, to attain the density-based constraints and wire length which will go into the objective to be minimized. Also, it divides the component placement into two parts - Globally placing the macros (pre-designed circuit block) and then moving them locally to legalize them and place the standard cells (the simplest standalone component of the circuit
